## Calvin Location Guesser


How well do you know Calvin campus? Want to compete with your friends to see who knows the most Calvin locations? Calvin Location Guesser is a mobile game where you try to identify a series of different locations around campus from just a set of pictures. You then have to guess the location that picture was taken in. Calvin Location Guesser would be very similiar to Geoguessr, but with a unique Calvin twist that allows you to compete with classmates for the highest score, and learn about new and interesting places. Maybe you're new to Calvin and looking for a quick way to get oriented around campus.  Whatever the case, Calvin Location Guesser will help you learn more about campus in a fun and unique way. Who knows, maybe you'll even find your new favorite study room!

We're currently working to include as many classrooms as possible from all the buildings around campus. Our stretch goal is to include even more locations with some unique questions to make the game even more comprehensive.
